          An application for support during puberty. The application is aimed at
           anyone going through puberty and the unknown areas regarding the topic
            and other areas of support.
          <br><br>
          The project is an application for the mobile market and is a progressional
          step towards puberty as the target audience will always be there and the
           requirement for this area is becoming more progressively mainstream but due to
            the fact that this area of growing up  still holds some social stigmas persons of
            the age group may find puberty confusing and may seek guidance that isn't  necessarily
            there or the persons may be in a remote location without access to services to answer questions.
            This project is formed around the familiar generational technological environment that the target audience is drawn towards.
          <br><br>
          The application shall include support and information for people who are having a hard time or
          otherwise cannot find the required information from other sources. The Application will have an
          incognito mode that allows for the application to be exited when the user requires a fast exit.
          The application will also allow for the update of information via a database
           on a cloud server this gives the application the added benefit of being able to be current with trends.

           <p class="boxTextLeft"> Information relating to puberty and other related
             health matters for many people can be hard to find, incomplete or simply
              non existent. There are many people that find they have questions that they
               are often too embarrassed to ask, find it difficult to raise with family members or avoid asking
               for fear of ridicule or ill treatment. This app aims to provide information and cover a broad
               range of puberty related topics for people of all ages, genders and sexual orientations in a
               single complete reference platform. Many of us have experienced limited knowledge of what lies
                ahead with regard to puberty and adulthood, most of us have learnt and gained experience by
                 having to learn the hard way, or spend a lot of time researching or simply doing things wrong.
          <br><br>
            All of us at one time or another would’ve appreciated having the information
            at a point in our lives and having it all in one place and easy to access would
            be advantageous for many. Helping to path the direction of the culture of adults
            who are informed can shape the way society as a whole will function in future generations
            to come knowledge is power the motivation it to help.

              Within the program of this ‘Puberty App’ key activities, facts and tips will be included; this describes the transformation that happens with estrogen, testosterone , gender transforming surgeries, sexual health and any other needs that come in later updates with the server based cloud idea of the project.
              <br><br>
              As a basics this application is a source of information for all kinds of people who are going through puberty or who just need the information by itself. There will be a homepage with an option to create an account and save the different pages that they will want to access later on. This account will be saved to the cloud so it can be accessed from other devices, for the moment it will just be mobiles, however, it will eventually expand to websites as well.
              Once the account has been created (or they login as guest) there will be spaces to add in their age, gender identification, sexual orientation and specific pronouns. These details will help to give options and suggest reading articles for the user. Each section will give the details in a fun and interactive manner so it is easier for neurodivergent people to read and take in.
              <br><br>
              The sections will be as followed:
              <br><br>

              Another part of this app will be the quick exit button somewhere on the page (in a corner) for anyone who does not want to be ‘caught’ on the app or reading something not allowed. This button will either completely close down the app or will switch the user’s mobile over to another app (chosen by the user). A feature like this allows for a quick exit in case of emergency such as; parents or guardians who do not want their children looking into LGBTQIA+ activities, almost being caught by a partner when the user does not want them to know etc. The quick exit button is for any user who does not wish for anyone to know they are looking at any of this information to protect their privacy.

               Tools and  technologies to be considered would be tools for the development
                of a mobile applications for the framework, web based services
                 for cloud services logins and updates for information relating
                 to the mobile app as well the local device will require a SQL
                 database for the applications information that can be stored or
                 updated via the cloud services syncing data.
               <br><br>
               The proposed development tools such as Android Studio for the mobile
               application is considered and cross platform tools such as Xamarin
               would be considered  but would rely on the code to be converted to
               another programming language opposed to that of Java within Android studio.
               <br><br>
               SQL database is part of android but if the system required a cross
               platform approach this will need to be more flexible to how xamarin
                would utilise this sort of Databasing.
               <br><br>
               Cloud based server for data storage would greatly increase the
               use of newer updated trends in the applications target audience;
                this not only can add features but also remove or add new information
                that may be misleading or deemed obsolete. Cloud Based services would work as a log in server to allow for authorisation.

               Technologies to use are mobile devices for the particulars
                of client privacy.

          <h class="boxTextTitle">Skills Required</h>
            <div class="section06Div01">
              <p class="boxTextLeft">
                The following skills are required for this sort of project and are
                 listed as to what skills are beneficial for the success of the project.
                <br><br>
                Programming.
                <br><br>
                 Software development.
                 <br><br>
                 Knowledge Base/Research.
                 <br><br>
                 Graphic design.
                 <br><br>
                 Programming skills - These are required for the basics of creating an
                 application. The application is heavily driven by this aspect
                 and will need to be planned and all code programmed for the different
                  features of the application such as the main GUI,user experience and
                   information areas to access databases it will all go into the application
                   via the programming code and  this will all connect to the rest of the skills required.
                <br><br>
                Software development - As the project is a software based idea
                this is a skill to allow for the development and planning of the
                 application this would entitle a SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
                  with target audience inclusions, design, deliverables time frames as well
                  as testing and expectation guidelines this will allow for the application
                  to be tested under different devices and circumstance with a plan.
                <br><br>
                Knowledge Base - A knowledgebase of the topic is required without
                 this knowledge the data will not be comprehensive and may lead
                  to a failure in the product. Knowledge and sources of informat
                  ion are key and will be required for research in the way of
                  getting the correct question to ask on the topic to enhance the information.
                <br><br>
                Graphic Design -  Not the highest ranked skill but one that would
                 help with the user experience of an application that would aid in
                  easier function and allow for more user interaction within the product.
                   Graphic design skills work with UI and UX design.

                Upon the successful creation of this project ‘Puberty App’, it will give people of all gender orientation, sexual identity and backgrounds of abuse. We hope to normalise the information relating to puberty and all other related matters for young people. We want to keep all this information out there for them to have the liberty to approach and learn on their own. They will never have to worry about learning things that should have been taught to them at a young age. It might not solve the problem of neglect and abuse that goes on, but it will help educate these people in areas where their parents or guardians might have failed or not educated themselves on. We are hopeful that the impact of this project will one be the education and validation on the people who need it and seek it out and the other is to get more ideas and suggestions from people who use this app. This can be added again for continuous improvement of the app and give everyone and anyone the best chance possible for input.
