      The Idea of making a basic set of instruction into a full-blown operation makes it an ideal job in the IT field with many opportunities to learn and
      teach the skills of programming. The part of development would be the programming side as it is the most interesting part of the process to create
      the workings of a software application.</p>

        This particular position is to program and create software to use within the company and with others outside the company.
        A position like this is quite attractive to me as it allows me to create things useful to others and myself.
         In my studies and my goal for my career is to be able to create software and/or build hardware for customers and companies to use.
         A position that gives me boundaries and requirements, but I still get my own creative freedom.

        I can see many opportunities available to teachers who have knowledge and experience in Information and Communications Technology.
        When I was given the option of choosing maths or IT for my curriculum subject, I chose IT. This Head of Information Technology role particularly
        interested me because it entails both a service-oriented and strategic mindset. I have been in the service industry, and I feel fulfilled when I can
        help a guest and make them happy. And now, I believe, to serve the future generation and help them build a successful future will be the kind of role I dream of.
         So, this is the reason why I chose this job opportunity.

      <p class="boxText">Cybersecurity engineering is one of the many fast growing roles in today's society. Different industries try to take advantage of others unethically.
         The role of cybersecurity is to “develop and supervise data and technology security systems to help prevent breaches, taps, and leaks associated with cybercrime.”
         It could also be described as, “information assurance engineer, information systems security engineer, and information security engineer.”
         Moreover, cybersecurity engineers install firewalls, breach detection systems, and work closely to monitor data to ensure that sensitive information
         isn’t being manipulated in anyways.
