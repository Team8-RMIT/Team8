      Group worked together as an amazing team that was able to undergo the challenges of the time required to put together the following report. The team worked together to achieve an end goal and to keep each other focused on the goal. When we didn't understand a section the group called on one another to support the idea of how to approach the task. If the task was difficult we tried to help one another. We worked tiresome on getting the most out of our meetings and to get to know one another's quirks and styles of ascertaining information.
<br><br>
Team 8 was a surprised mix of all aspects of knowledge and general life skills. We had programming and communication as well as creative writing skills in the team. This led to the project idea and the other formats of how we did the assignment to come to life. We all had busy lives but were able to work together to push the assignment to its needs and work with any missing attributes that each did not know or had limited knowledge on. The surprise was that a group of strangers could work together to obtain the goals set out by the personalities in our team where very well received by one another.
<br><br>
Strangers who walks in a different parts of life, but has a common interest in IT was able to worked brilliantly to put out a high quality report and shown a great professionalism throughout. There was not one person who missed out on content as we all have good intentions for each other and was helpful when a member was struggle. Each and everyone of us brings many experiences in different areas and was able to integrate to the team which was helpful. Overall the team dynamic was a success, as we completed the task to the best of our ability and most importantly managed to overcome obstacles together as a team.
<br><br>
Ashton mentions “Improvement we would see is the planning stage in our actions”. The actions were reflected well and we did have some form of ideas but we think next time around we would add more actions to allow for the time frame to have more of a buffer. The planning stage was the hardest but once we had worked on this we had a plan and took off from there. Everyone had an idea it made it more smoother to contribute and get on with the project.

      The task looked straight forward and required little direction to set up the group project dynamics. The team met up with one another as complete strangers and have found many ways to collaborate to get the end goal within communication. The team was open for suggestions and helped one another out to ensure we met the guidelines set out in the assignment PDF. The one thing that was slightly overwhelming was that we were required to get a plan of action and this wasn't always the most forward thinking plan at first. It wasn't until we got halfway that we were able to engage the tasks and move forward at a pace.
      <br><br>
       I found the dynamics to be effective and the leadership shown by Elijah was motivating to get the meeting on a roll and start the tasks. Mark was awesome at his brainstorming skills,Rukshana was progressive at setting up the GitHub repository and added her involvement into all  the tasks. Susan was very on point with her tasks as well as the group task and her written work was very well structured. Every member was great to work with and the team had many different walks of life rolled into one making it a fun experience that would recommend this team a 5/5 stars great team!

        This team as a whole worked together quite well as the communication between the five of us was absolutely brilliant. None of us were scared to ask a question or communicate something we were thinking and we were most often on the same page with everything. There were very minimal problems to solve and any that did arise was something that could be solved within a few minutes at most.
  The start of the group meetings was slow, all of us trying to find our feet within the group and seeing who would be the lead. This meant that we got slightly behind in our assignment and weren’t entirely sure what we were supposed to be doing. In saying that, as soon as we figured out the tasks at hand and started our shared google document everything went into full swing. We created a Facebook group chat, had our meetings all planned out (every Monday and Thursday at 6.00pm Melbourne time) and our repository was created.
<br><br>
  Each person dedicated an amazing amount of effort and commitment to this group and this assignment and it is shown in the work we have submitted.
  The webpage Ashton set up and did almost all of the planning for, he took great care in the programming of the HTML and as such has been able to showcase our ideas in an interesting manner.
  Rukshana created our GitHub Repository and set it all up for us to use, she explained to us where she was faltering and allowed us all to help her and as a team we were able to talk her through things to do with GitHub which allowed us to strength in the group.
  Mark had a great hand in the Project Idea and setting up how that would look and what areas needed to be completed when, within the meetings he displayed great leadership and was able to direct the conversation to the areas of the assignment that needed to be addressed.
  Susan was brilliant in her knowledge and contribution, when discussing tasks and what areas each person needed to do she was more than willing to take on whatever part was necessary and as such created a safe space where everyone was comfortable with the tasks.

        This assignment was fun to be apart of. We were nervous at first as with meeting and working with new people is, but we slowly began working our way towards a finished product. Elijah is a wonderful person who had a brilliant project idea that we all related to one way or another and we were very quick to decide the project idea that we were going to pursue. We struggled at first to get a foothold on what work we had to achieve and when, but after entering our first large paragraphs of content each in the document, the work began to flood in.
        <br><br>
        I believe we were very lucky to have such a diverse group of people with very easy going and professional mannerisms that made putting this all together relatively simple. We had a sixth member of the group initially but that person wasn’t heard from again and the group moved forward with the members we had. I think everybody put in a stellar effort at one point or another when it was needed and I’m very happy to see our assignment come together as well as it has. Well done Team8! It would be good to work with this group again.

        I had fun doing this group assignment. Everyone was proactive, friendly, helpful and cheerful. From the very first day I liked that everyone was on the same page, and we helped each other with the assignment. I believe our work coordination went really well. If one initiated setting up MS-Teams while creating and setting up documents in google docs and other set up GitHub page and so on. Each individual was initiated to take over their tasks and informed the team what they were working on so others could work on other tasks. The other thing is I had this issue with the website which I was not able to figure out myself on what went wrong. But we all worked together on this one session and fixed it up for which I am very thankful for. Everything went perfectly so I don't think there is anything that could be improved except for the fact that there was a time limit. From this group project, I learnt the importance of an individual contribution towards teamwork. It helped us complete the assignment smoothly. And everyone was very understanding of each other’s situation. GitHub was set up amazingly by Ashton and I loved how it looked on the website.

        Team8 as whole have worked very well together for the past couple of weeks and we came across many challenges but has always find ways to solved the problems as a unit straight away. It was an amazing experience to be apart of and I wouldn’t want to have any other way. We have variety of cultures and background, personality traits which makes the Microsoft Teams environment that much more fun to work and share ideas in. Everyone was very upstanding but also was very professional about it. First meeting was pretty much just getting to know each other and work out who would lead the group. We didn’t really assign anyone to lead but in saying that, I thought that everyone knew what was needed and had high expectations for themselves and the team to get things to start and finish tasks with quality. I thought personally we started off slow but once we have set goals and accomplishment we work cohesively well at reasonable past.
        <br><br>
        Everyone has put max effort into the assignment and worked really hard to manage time, considering we are all at a different stage of our lives.
        At the beginning Elijah stepped up to the leader role and assigned tasks for each member to get us rolling on with the assignment. Shown great decision making, and great leadership.
        Rukshana works brilliantly well getting assigned tasks done with great professionalism and displays high quality work throughout.
        Ashton was amazing with the HTML/CSS side, the website that was planned and constructed by him was very professional in terms of layouts and have chosen colour palettes that work really well.
        Mark had displayed great leadership in team meetings, he was able to point out areas that needed attention and was able to address actions needed to be taken with a well understanding of the criteria.
        Overall, I thought we all display high standard professionalism within the work and put max effort into the assignment. We worked really well considering the time that was given and the different situations that everyone faces.
