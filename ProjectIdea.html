        <p class="boxTextLeft">
          An application for support during puberty. The application is aimed at
           anyone going through puberty and the unknown areas regarding the topic
            and other areas of support.
          <br><br>
          The project is an application for the mobile market and is a progressional
          step towards puberty as the target audience will always be there and the
           requirement for this area is becoming more progressively mainstream but due to
            the fact that this area of growing up  still holds some social stigmas persons of
            the age group may find puberty confusing and may seek guidance that isn't  necessarily
            there or the persons may be in a remote location without access to services to answer questions.
            This project is formed around the familiar generational technological environment that the target audience is drawn towards.
          <br><br>
          The application shall include support and information for people who are having a hard time or
          otherwise cannot find the required information from other sources. The Application will have an
          incognito mode that allows for the application to be exited when the user requires a fast exit.
          The application will also allow for the update of information via a database
           on a cloud server this gives the application the added benefit of being able to be current with trends.

       <h class="boxTextTitle">Topic</h>
         <div class="section06Div01">
           <p class="boxTextLeft">
             What is proposed for this project is to create an application that
             can utilise information and to deliver it in a fun way.
             The project is an application and the idea is to have the
             application created to function as is as well as allow for
             changes when new information is available. The application is
              to be simple and easy to exit on request. The application
              will be sent out as a free application.
          <br><br>
          Adding to the outcomes the project wishes to be a data collaboration of
          information that is easy to access and could be recommended
          to services who deal with the target audience. The application
           is to be frank and honest and not shy away from
           social stigmas of the subjects involved.

       <h class="boxTextTitle">Motivation</h>
         <div class="section06Div01">
           <p class="boxTextLeft"> Information relating to puberty and other related
             health matters for many people can be hard to find, incomplete or simply
              non existent. There are many people that find they have questions that they
               are often too embarrassed to ask, find it difficult to raise with family members or avoid asking
               for fear of ridicule or ill treatment. This app aims to provide information and cover a broad
               range of puberty related topics for people of all ages, genders and sexual orientations in a
               single complete reference platform. Many of us have experienced limited knowledge of what lies
                ahead with regard to puberty and adulthood, most of us have learnt and gained experience by
                 having to learn the hard way, or spend a lot of time researching or simply doing things wrong.
          <br><br>
            All of us at one time or another would’ve appreciated having the information
            at a point in our lives and having it all in one place and easy to access would
            be advantageous for many. Helping to path the direction of the culture of adults
            who are informed can shape the way society as a whole will function in future generations
            to come knowledge is power the motivation it to help.
          <br><br>
          The motivation is to inform people regarding puberty and other health matters.
          The project is one that is motivated by the existence of information that can be
           hard to find or to raise with people's families or support network.
            <br> <br>
          The project is interesting as it aims to work with the
           progression of society and tackle the normilisation of transgender,
           lesbian and gay and other aspects of the person prefrence by not
           shaming young people who need advice.
          <br>
          Furthermore, the app is intended to provide a better understanding of ourselves. The motive behind this particular idea is that accessing information relating to puberty and other related health matters for many people can be hard to find, incomplete or simply non existent. Puberty App has all of the above while supporting through those phases, often questions that are raised can be embarrassing and uncomfortable to bring up accessing those information is at reach. Normalising this idea will create a positive and open environment for upcoming employees.

         The landscape of the puberty applications show apps that are two gender
         specific or religious based and not showing the science/social based approach
          on sexual identities and gender assignment. This application aims for
          transparency in these topics and to be able to incorporate a factual
           basis for the information.

              Within the program of this ‘Puberty App’ key activities, facts and tips will be included; this describes the transformation that happens with estrogen, testosterone , gender transforming surgeries, sexual health and any other needs that come in later updates with the server based cloud idea of the project.
              <br><br>
              As a basics this application is a source of information for all kinds of people who are going through puberty or who just need the information by itself. There will be a homepage with an option to create an account and save the different pages that they will want to access later on. This account will be saved to the cloud so it can be accessed from other devices, for the moment it will just be mobiles, however, it will eventually expand to websites as well.
              Once the account has been created (or they login as guest) there will be spaces to add in their age, gender identification, sexual orientation and specific pronouns. These details will help to give options and suggest reading articles for the user. Each section will give the details in a fun and interactive manner so it is easier for neurodivergent people to read and take in.
              <br><br>
              The sections will be as followed:

              Another part of this app will be the quick exit button somewhere on the page (in a corner) for anyone who does not want to be ‘caught’ on the app or reading something not allowed. This button will either completely close down the app or will switch the user’s mobile over to another app (chosen by the user). A feature like this allows for a quick exit in case of emergency such as; parents or guardians who do not want their children looking into LGBTQIA+ activities, almost being caught by a partner when the user does not want them to know etc. The quick exit button is for any user who does not wish for anyone to know they are looking at any of this information to protect their privacy.

             The project is an application sharing information and is a not-for-profit application.
             It is planned to be done in the form of an application with a hidden login that once
              passed allows for tailored content as well as access to a range of information.
              The project was an idea from a previous team member whom the team collaborated with.
              The team had agreed that this is a progressive topic and the idea creating the project
              can show the area of topic that the project refers to.
             <br><br>
             The project so far has gone into the mock-up creation stage and can
             be worked to become an application that can be installed into a mobile
              platform for testing in a mobile environment or emulated environment.
               The project requires the use of tools and technologies primarily available
               as open source but is not limited to paid services such as cloud services and
                other pay as you go libraries within the development side of the application.
              <br><br><a id="ninthItem"></a>
              The project is a tool for helping and is based on a mobile platform
              so the following information shows an initial mock-up to indicate a plan
               for the progress of the application. The next section of the plan shows the mock-up
               and explains some of the proposed ideas that go into the plan of the project to work
                on the platform of a mobile application.

                The following is a plan of action that is proposed to be done

                 The current stage that the project is upto is reflected in the
                 creation of mock-up being stage 2 in the following plan.
               <br><br>
               Stage 1 - Create the Plan - This stage creates the idea of the plan
               including the target audience, content and other information needed for the project.
                This is the brainstorming stage.
               <br><br>
               Stage 2 - Create Application Mock-up - This requires creating a mock-up to demonstrate
               the application is a non-functional or basic functional artefact to show what the app may
               look like prior to the end agreed finish of graphics and resources.
               <br><br>
               Stage 3 - Obtain resources - Gather information on the resources used in the
               application as well as services that are required for the function of the application.
                This requires a research process and projects as well as setting up of services.
               <br><br>
               Stage 4 - Development of application - Application starts to be programmed
                from plans and the formation of the information is amalgamated into the development.
               <br><br>
               Stage 5 - Test plan and risk management plans - Creation of documents for
               testing and the risk management plan for the delivery of the application to market.
               Important phase for the completion of this stage can run alongside the development of the application.
               <br><br>
               Stage 6 - Completion of application version 1 - Complete the application for the
               first trial to market. This is the stage in which all final inputs are to be done
               and any remaining ideas or functions can be placed into the next stage.
               <br><br>
               Stage 7- Ongoing support plan - Creation of supporting patches, documents
               and other planned upgrades. This stage is where the next lot of ideas,
                innovations and any other upgrades or responses to feedback are considered or executed.
               <br><br>
               Stages are linear and the project runs via the plan but the
               mitigation of unforeseen circumstances may cause delays and some
               stages might be able to work within one another to accomplish an end result.
               <br><br><a id="tenthItem"></a>
               The plan we would like to adopt is that of an “Agile”
               approach that will allow for the project to be flexible
               and adhere to industry standards of project management within
                this sort of project type.

             application does not ask for the user's email address this was the
             simplest way to mitigate the user's privacy.
            <br><br>
            The user also can create an account this is done by clicking

             <p class="boxTextLeft">
               Stage 1 - Creating a plan for the creation of the overall idea for the project this
                is expected to be limited to the amount of time to create a SRS (software requirement specification)
                as a deliverable for the application.
               <br><br>
               Stage 2 - Create the mockup that is limited to the information in an SRS documentation and will
                require the creation of a prototype with features with minimal functioning or dummy programming
                to show the effect of how the SRS information translates this can help to explain what future stakeholder
                 may want to known if funding is required.
               <br><br>
               Stage 3 - Obtaining resources may be limited to what is available and what time frames for fact
                checking on information; this can be limited as well if the information is required from a human
                source and that source is also time restricted. Delivering basic information and awaiting cloud updates can mitigate this.
               <br><br>
               Stage 4 -  Development of the application will be limited to the time frame again this will be
                limited to a basic first release application with information being simple this limitation will
                allow for feedback.
               <br><br>
               Stage 5 - Test and risk plans are to be done. The limits on this stage will be test numbers,
               participants, time and risk documentation creation. Test to a small number of persons then a
               test after release to polish anything missed in first release. Risk management is always ongoing
               and the major risks will be delivered.
               <br><br>
               Stage 6 - Completion of the first version of the application will be limited to time. The
                deliverable should aim at a simple user interface focused on user experience with parts
                of the application being dynamic to allow for information change via cloud.
               <br><br>
               Stage 7 - Ongoing support documents and updates, patches are limited to
               what can be taken from tests after the product is released to market. Support
               documents can be online and updated at any stage. Patches are limited to knowledge
               of what is required for feedback.

             <p class="boxTextLeft">
               Tools and  technologies to be considered would be tools for the development
                of a mobile applications for the framework, web based services
                 for cloud services logins and updates for information relating
                 to the mobile app as well the local device will require a SQL
                 database for the applications information that can be stored or
                 updated via the cloud services syncing data.
               <br><br>
               The proposed development tools such as Android Studio for the mobile
               application is considered and cross platform tools such as Xamarin
               would be considered  but would rely on the code to be converted to
               another programming language opposed to that of Java within Android studio.
               <br><br>
               SQL database is part of android but if the system required a cross
               platform approach this will need to be more flexible to how xamarin
                would utilise this sort of Databasing.
               <br><br>
               Cloud based server for data storage would greatly increase the
               use of newer updated trends in the applications target audience;
                this not only can add features but also remove or add new information
                that may be misleading or deemed obsolete. Cloud Based services would work as a log in server to allow for authorisation.
               <br><br>
               Technologies to use are mobile devices for the particulars
                of client privacy.
                <br><br>
                Other Tools and Technologies required is a computer with access to Android studio
                this is the main program for the development of the Application. Software
                 license is free and will only require frequent updates to the software.
                <br><br>
                Technologies required are a modern PC for application development and a
                modern mobile device running an android operating system this can be within the
                 last 3 years as the application will be created to utilise older API or SDK or
                 Android versions preferably API KitKat (version 19) and above.

                The following skills are required for this sort of project and are
                 listed as to what skills are beneficial for the success of the project.
                <br><br>
                Programming.
                <br><br>
                 Software development.
                 <br><br>
                 Knowledge Base/Research.
                 <br><br>
                 Graphic design.
                 <br><br>
                 Programming skills - These are required for the basics of creating an
                 application. The application is heavily driven by this aspect
                 and will need to be planned and all code programmed for the different
                  features of the application such as the main GUI,user experience and
                   information areas to access databases it will all go into the application
                   via the programming code and  this will all connect to the rest of the skills required.
                <br><br>
                Software development - As the project is a software based idea
                this is a skill to allow for the development and planning of the
                 application this would entitle a SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
                  with target audience inclusions, design, deliverables time frames as well
                  as testing and expectation guidelines this will allow for the application
                  to be tested under different devices and circumstance with a plan.
                <br><br>
                Knowledge Base - A knowledgebase of the topic is required without
                 this knowledge the data will not be comprehensive and may lead
                  to a failure in the product. Knowledge and sources of informat
                  ion are key and will be required for research in the way of
                  getting the correct question to ask on the topic to enhance the information.
                <br><br>
                Graphic Design -  Not the highest ranked skill but one that would
                 help with the user experience of an application that would aid in
                  easier function and allow for more user interaction within the product.
                   Graphic design skills work with UI and UX design.

              Considering the average age of puberty, the test will likely target young adults ages 11 years to 25 years but it's different for everyone. Testing users can help to better user friendly applications and also improve the information that is given to the users.
              <br><br>
              Targeted testing of young adults who are attending primary/high school and also university students will provide data that is needed. Social media campaigns are a great way to collect data. This allows users to feel more comfortable and open to give those information without identifying who they are.

                 <li class="dotpoints">Scope Creep  - This could be a risk if there are parts of the project that are not estimated such as time to create application or resource delays such as information.</li>

                 <li class="dotpoints">Poor risk management - Risk management in the software development regarding the teams used to spot any potential issues make for comprehensive risk assessment. If the team has poor risk then creating mitigation is not efficient.</li>

                 <li class="dotpoints">Incapable software - With the advent of mobile technology the application may not function on some devices this needs to be mitigated by way of using older versions of software. The hardest task is that new devices may make older software obsolete.</li>

                 <li class="dotpoints">Target Audience - A risk to this project is if the application can get to its target audience. The success of the project depends on enough users downloading the application.</li>

               The project was an idea from a previous team member, Elijah Crowe, who
                unfortunately dropped from the course. It was a pleasure to work with him,
                and it is such a shame to see him leave, as it was his idea to begin with. However,
                the team agreed to continue his project plan. Everybody in the team gave their best in
                this project, as we all participated with our individual talents.
              <br><br>
                The members were able to help each other out who needed support and motivated each other
                to continue to get the tasks done. The team decided to meet every Monday and Thursday at 7 pm
                 for 30-45 minutes. We used Ms-Teams to organise the formal meeting as the members lived in
                 different states, and a face-to-face meeting was impossible. We also created a chat group in
                 Messenger to have that instant support if anyone needs to reach out.
              <br><br>
               RMIT email was used to send reminders for meetings to the team members. The members
               communicated their personal issues if they could not attend the meeting, mainly through
                the Messenger chat. Work breakdown structure was used to guide the process in the project.
                 Overall, the group have formed a great friendship and are more steady and experienced going
                 into the next part of the project.

                       development of this type of project. A software developer with  programming
                       experience, a strong understanding of databases, user experience and graphical
                        interfaces are essential.
                      <br><br>
                      The software developer will need to be able to create a work plan and have knowledge
                       in many aspects of programming libraries as well as the use of APIs for servers in the
                       cloud based part of this project. Also the developer would need to know how to professional
                        document work for the purpose of the team regarding any expansion in the future.

                       will allow for smooth communication via email, phone or other push communication to
                       communicate with stakeholders who require updates or work.

                      The skills required also need to be tied in with budgeting to allow for the
                      costing of the project for success in marketing, physical materials and work
                      orders to be estimated correctly. A great leader would be desired for this role
                       with the ability to also manage a team.

                Upon the successful creation of this project ‘Puberty App’, it will give people of all gender orientation, sexual identity and backgrounds of abuse. We hope to normalise the information relating to puberty and all other related matters for young people. We want to keep all this information out there for them to have the liberty to approach and learn on their own. They will never have to worry about learning things that should have been taught to them at a young age. It might not solve the problem of neglect and abuse that goes on, but it will help educate these people in areas where their parents or guardians might have failed or not educated themselves on. We are hopeful that the impact of this project will one be the education and validation on the people who need it and seek it out and the other is to get more ideas and suggestions from people who use this app. This can be added again for continuous improvement of the app and give everyone and anyone the best chance possible for input.
