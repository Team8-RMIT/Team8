          <p class="boxText">Currently studying for a Bachelor of IT at RMIT and also playing football professionally representing the U20 Matildas Team.
            Rasamee is a hard working person who is willing to learn and take on many challenges. I was born in Thailand and moved to Western Sydney when I was 12.
            Being in Australia has allowed me to do many things that I love, such as playing football, while I was able to study at a great school.
            Other than practicing football and going to the gym, I also like spending time at the beach, hiking and exploring places around Sydney.
            CNC machining was something I really liked when I was working as a Boilermaker and other than figuring problems with tech, I am quite new to IT.
            Team 8 was chosen for our Team Project.</p>
